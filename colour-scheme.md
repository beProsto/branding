# Background Colour
- `#ffffff`
	- Just a simple white background. 

# Main Colour
- `#5af95a`
	- Used in the logo/s of mine, is a colour for the most important text. (In most cases, just used for my name.)

# Sidekick Colour
- `#00f4ff`
	- Used in cases where there should be some additional text added to the main one. (An example is found in my [Youtube Backdrop](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkxUfg3w7H4o3m7wcXBYAGA))
